    <p style="font-weight: 900;">This web app was specifficaly targeted for a friend which is focused on the game Rocket League, trying to master the game and become better!</p>
    <p>So this is how it works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You select a category from the given options when clicked on the <b>burger menu.</b></li>
        <li>After that you get to choose if you would like to train (in Rocket Leage) on hard mode, medium or easy</li>
        <li>When you have selected the mode, you can no start training (in Rocket League) and assign every shot on goal or trick done by either pressing <b>plus(adding a score)</b> <br><b>miss(ex: missed a goal)</b> or in case of a illegal goal you can subtrack the attempt</li>
        <li>After you're done with the training you take a screen shot by tapping on the <b>righ sided</b> button so you can save them locally</li>
        <li>For the next time you want to train your skills you can easily track if you've become better by uploading those screenshot by tapping on the <b>left sided</b> button</li>
        <i>(Keep in mind, it only supports .PNG format ;D)</i>
